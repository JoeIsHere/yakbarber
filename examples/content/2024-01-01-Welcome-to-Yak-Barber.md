## Getting Started

To create your own posts, simply create Markdown files in your `content/` directory with YAML frontmatter at the top. Each post needs two required fields:

- **Title**: The post title (must start with an alphanumeric character)
- **Date**: Publication date in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format

Optional fields like **Author** and **Category** are passed through to templates.
